# Attention Model for Capacitated Vechicle Routing Problem(CVRP)
A capstone project aims to construct a new reinforcement learning model to solve Capacitated Vechicle Routing Problem.
We will apply hyperparameter search and policy gradient methods to attention model and construct a more efficient model (using less computational resource/ less training time) for CVRP problem.


## Apply Weights & Bias API to attention model(Done). 
- monitor the training process of models with different hyperparameter.
- conduct hyperparameter search and visualize the training process.  

The model applied Weights & Bias API [here](https://github.com/angela18199/CVRP_RL_Capstone/tree/main/hyper_attention)



## Apply other policy gradient methods to the attention model(in progress).     
- merging garage with attention model.

The baseline model is based on this repository [here](https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route)
