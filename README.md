# Attention Model for Capacitated Vechicle Routing Problem(CVRP)
A capstone project aims to construct a new reinforcement learning model to solve Capacitated Vechicle Routing Problem.
We will apply hyperparameter search and policy gradient methods to attention model and construct a more efficient model (using less computational resource/ less training time) for CVRP problem.

Task Done:

Apply Weights & Bias API to 
- monitor the training process of models with different hyperparameter.
- conduct hyperparameter search and visualize the training process.

To do:
Resume training process during hyperparameter search to run a bigger size of problem.  

Apply other policy gradient methods to the attention model.  

The baseline model is based on this repository [here](https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route)
