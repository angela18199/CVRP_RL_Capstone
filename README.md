# Attention Model for Capacitated Vechicle Routing Problem(CVRP)
A capstone project aims to construct a new reinforcement learning model to solve Capacitated Vechicle Routing Problem.
We will apply hyperparameter search and policy gradient methods to attention model and construct a more efficient model (using less computational resource/ less training time) for CVRP problem.

Task Done:

Apply Weights & Bias API to 
- monitor the training process of models with different hyperparameter.
- conduct hyperparameter search and visualize the training process.  
The model applied Weights & Bias API [here](https://github.com/angela18199/CVRP_RL_Capstone/tree/main/hyper_attention)

To do:  
Apply other policy gradient methods to the attention model.   
- merging garage with attention model.[here](https://github.com/angela18199/CVRP_RL_Capstone/tree/main/garage_attention)



* The baseline model is based on this repository [here](https://github.com/wouterkool/attention-learn-to-route)
